Based on instructions from the Odin Project, the project UI was built entirely using 
CSS Grid. 

# What I Learned

I encountered problems trying to get everything to line-up properly without using Flexbox.
So mamy times within this project I could have used flex to accomplish the easiest thing. 
Flex for navigation would have been utilized to better effect in my opinion. Also within the
main content, I could have settled the UI much easier, but I stayed true to the project guidelines.
The guidelines being, that if at all possible, Grid was to be used to accoplish the task.
